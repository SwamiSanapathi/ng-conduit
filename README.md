# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Angular 14 with Standalone Component codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://ng-conduit.netlify.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged Front-end application built with **Angular 14 w/ Standalone Component** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

This is to explore and showcase how **Angular 14 w/ Standalone Component** would look like in a project.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

> Describe the general architecture of your app here

-   All Components are authored with `standalone:true`
-   Experimenting with `inject()` instead of traditional Constructor DI
-   Using `@ngrx/component-store` as State Management solution
-   API SDK Stub is generated with [Nswag](http://nswag.org/)
